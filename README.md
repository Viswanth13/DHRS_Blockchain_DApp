# MyDapp - Decentralized Healthcare System

## Overview
MyDapp is a decentralized healthcare system built using Ethereum smart contracts and a React frontend. The application allows patients to manage their medical records securely and grant access to doctors while ensuring privacy and data integrity. The project leverages the Hardhat framework for smart contract development and deployment, along with the Web3.js library for blockchain interaction in the frontend.

## Features

- **Doctor Registration**: Admin can register doctors on the platform.
- **Medical Record Management**: Patients can update their medical records and store them on the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System).
- **Access Control**: Patients can grant or revoke access to their medical records for registered doctors.
- **Token System**: Includes a basic token system for managing balances.
